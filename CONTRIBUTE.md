# How to contribute

Thanks for showing your interest to give back and help the open source community. In order for you to start a task you want to visit https://github.com/codetapacademy/codetap.academy/issues and either create a new **feature** or **bug** by pressing the **New issue** green button or browse the existing list of issues to see if you can pick up any of them and start working on it. If you are a student of **CodeTap Academy** than you want to pick up the very first issue no matter what it is and start the process of solving it:

1. Gather info
    * Read carefully the requirements to gain a better overview and ask more questions to the person that create the issue if needed or any project owner.
    * If you're missing skills do the required research and get in touch with the CodeTap Academy community on our Discord server.
2. Grab the latest version
    
    * **1st time**
        * Fork the **codetap.academy** project on your personal profile
        * **clone** the project on your local machine (PC or laptop)
    * **any other time**
        * Open a browser and navigate to the **codetap.academy** project on your personal profile.
        * create a **P**ull **R**equest from the **dev** branch of the **codetapacademy** organization, **codetap.academy** project, to your **dev** branch of your personal profile, on your **codetap.academy** project. 
        * Accept the PR and merge all the new changes into the copy that sits on your own personal profile.
        * Switch to your local machine and make sure that you're commited all your latest changes if there are any since the last commit / push.
        * Check on which branch you are using `git status` and if you're not on `dev` you want to switch to it using `git checkout dev`
        * Grab the latest changes from your personal profile on **GitHub** and pull them to your local machine using `git pull`
    * Create a new branch using `git checkout -b new-branch-name`.
        * If the issue title is `fix: add disabled style to the button component#368`, you want to create a branch with `git checkout -b fix--add-disabled-style-to-the-button-component#368`.
        * If the issue title is `feature: add history graph to lecture#468`, you want to create a branch with `git checkout -b feature--add-history-graph-to-lecture#468`.
    * Start working on your solution. You can do a **PR** as soon as you have a commit or any time later on, when you have one or more commits.
        * _Note_: if your work is not finished yet and you want others to be aware of your progress, prefix the title of your **PR** with **WIP**, like: `WIP: my nice pull request name`. WIP stands for **W**ork **i**n **P**rogress and will instruct others to not merge or reject this pull request until the title has been updated without **WIP**.
        * It is also your responsability, as part of the definition of done, to continuously put the effort to get this PR accepted or rejected as soon as possible. If this means you have to chase people around and be pushy and remind them more often than normal, than that's what you want to do. **GET THE PR DONE**.
