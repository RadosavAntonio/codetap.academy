# play list item

As of 26th of January 2020, the play list has been restructured and redefined, in order to provide a better user experience in a smaller form factor.

There are a lot of tiny things to do in order to achieve that.

## Section



### Collapse section in playlist
As a user I want to be able to see a chevron pointing up or down, to the right of the section title. 

* When the chevron is pointing up, it indicates that the lecture list in this section is expanded and I can click on the chevron to collapse it and transitio the chevron to point down.
* When the chevron is pointing down, it indicates that the lecture list is hidden and I can click on the chevron to expand the list of lectures and transition the chevron to point up.
