# New play list section and lecture features

As of 26th of January 2020, the play list has been restructured and redefined, in order to provide a better user experience in a smaller form factor.

There are a lot of tiny things to do in order to achieve that.

## Section

### Display completed vs total lectures

As a user I want to be able to see how many lectures I have completed in a particular section and how many total lectures are in that section. This info should be present before the section title (to the left of it). Example: 
* 0/9 would suggest that there are 9 lectures in total in this section and 0 of them are completed
* 3/12 would suggest that there are 12 lectures in total in this section and 3 of them are completed
* 7/7 would suggest that there are 7 lectures in total in this section and all of them are completed

### Collapse section in playlist
As a user I want to be able to see a chevron pointing up or down, to the right of the section title. 

* When the chevron is pointing up, it indicates that the lecture list in this section is expanded and I can click on the chevron to collapse it and transitio the chevron to point down.
* When the chevron is pointing down, it indicates that the lecture list is hidden and I can click on the chevron to expand the list of lectures and transition the chevron to point up.

## Lecture

### Description of a lecture


### Reposition the picture preview

The picture preview is too small to provide any meaningful information and can make room for more relevant content to be presented. As a user I can get a suggestion about the lesson from the title of it and I can also get a better understanding if the expand description button allows me to view more info.
* remove the image from being displayed to the left of the title
* add the image as a tooltip when the user hovers with the mouse the lecture box and have it displayed to the left of the lecture. The tooltip should be big enough for the content of the image, especially the text, to be readable.
