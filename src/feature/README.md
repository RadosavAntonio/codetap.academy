# CodeTap feature update list (draft 1)

## CodeTap Merits

CodeTap Academy wants to help future developers to become professionals as quickly as possible without having to restrict the access to our courses or public resources. A user will be able to unlock courses using CodeTap Merits or subscribing as members to our website.

### Unlock all courses

When you subscribe and become a member you'll unlock all courses that fall under that subscription and you'll have access to them for as long as you're a member.

### Unlock courses for FREE
CodeTap Merits cand be earned by participating in daily, weekly and other repeatable activities of CodeTap Academy. You'll be able to unlock all of our courses with the exception of the ones that fall under the mentored level. All courses unlocked using CodeTap Merits will remain accessible even if you are a subscibed member and choose to stop your subscription.

### Earning CodeTap Merits

Each and every day, after you've presented your stand-up update and it has been validated and accepted, you'll be able to earn CodeTap Merits and have activated your XP MultiBooster bonus. 

### What do real life clients and employers love?

Showing discipline and focus, passion and determination is what future employers and clients love to see in you, so we'll reward you for this as well. Each full week that you finished all of our daily tasks, we'll double your earned CodeTap Merits. Each full five weeks of finishing all of our daily tasks will multiply your earned CodeTap Merits by 2.5, for a total of 5x times (2 times weekly * 2.5 at 5 weeks = 5 times).

## XP Booster

### Default XP reward

All actions that can reward XP will default to the minimum reward if no stand-up update is present and validated for that day.

### Normal XP reward

Once a stand-up update has been validated and accepted, each action will reward its normal value anywhere between 25 and 250.

### XP Boost

The daily XP boost will double any XP earned until the next day reset.

In order to activate your daily XP boost you want to post your daily stand-up update on all suggested social media websites. This boost does not require you to have your face present in the video.

### Super XP boost

The Supre XP boost will further multiply any XP earned by 2.5 times. The multiplier will reach 5x (2x * 2.5x). An example would be: 

```
100xp (unboosted) × 2 × 2.5 = 500xp (boosted)
```
This update requires your face to be present.
